# M-Lab `data-support`

M-Lab strives to provide accessible entry points for a variety of audiences to explore and use our open data. Our [visualization site](https://viz.measurementlab.net), is one example. For most researchers, analysts, and advocates, the visualization website is a good way to get started understanding what M-Lab data exists. However, digging further into the data usually requires support and onboarding, particularly for rigorous research.

To encourage broad understanding of various ways to work with M-Lab data, we provide [getting started documentation on our website](https://www.measurementlab.net/data/docs/). Additionally, we've developer this repository to complement our documentation, which contains examples, code, and project files for working with M-Lab data.

## Contributions

Please fork this repository and use the examples for your own learning. The M-Lab team also welcomes your contributions to this repository in the form of issues, questions, and pull requests. If you are working with M-Lab data and are willing to share your work, please send us a pull request! You can also ask questions to M-Lab Support directly at [support@measurementlab.net](mailto:support@measurementlab.net) or engage in dialog with other M-Lab users on the [M-Lab Discuss Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/measurementlab.net/forum/#!forum/discuss).

## Organization of this repository

The examples and code included in this repository are organized according to the tool used. For example, to learn about using [R](https://www.r-project.org/) / [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/) to query, analyze, and visualize M-Lab data, look in the [**R**](https://github.com/m-lab/data-support/tree/master/R) folder. 

General resources for getting started with M-Lab data can be found in our [Data Documentation](https://www.measurementlab.net/data/docs/) on the M-Lab website.
